  Finds words that match a given description.

          - Letters represent known characters in the word and must be at the same position they appear.

This improved version introduces a dictionary `known_letters` to track known letters based on their position in the word. It iterates through the description:

- If the character is a digit, it checks if the position already has a known letter. If not, it stores a placeholder character in the dictionary.
- If the character is a letter, it checks if the position already has a known letter and ensures they match. Otherwise, it stores the known letter in the dictionary.
- It then builds a "potential_word" string by filling known letters and placeholders for unknown positions.
- It verifies if the potential word length matches the actual word. If not, it means the description doesn't fit.
- Finally, for each unknown letter placeholder, it iterates through all possible letters and recursively calls itself with the potential word filled with the current letter. It also checks if there were any recursive matches found. If not, it means the potential word itself is a match and adds it to the result.

This approach allows descriptions shorter than the actual word and finds all possible words that fit the given description.
